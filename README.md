## What I Learned About GitHub.

I realized I first need to create a new repository on GitHub. Then, clone my repository
and add a README.md file where they aleady give you a startup option to include it. 
Lastly, push this file to GitHub in the terminal by typing ''' git clone https:// ''' blah blah URL 
and create a GitHub Pages website for this repository. 

So far, I am learning and getting the hang of it all.
